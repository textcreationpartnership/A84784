#An epistle to all people on the earth; and the ignorance of all the world, both professors and teachers, of the birth that must be silent, and of the birth that is to speak, which declares God; and the difference betwixt silence and speaking. Shewing to all the people upon earth, that they may come to an understanding of themselves; and may know that Christ Jesus, the Light of the world, is their teacher to God, or their condemnation from him. Also shewing that it was the practice of many to wait in silence upon God, to hear his word, and know his voice. By G.F.#
